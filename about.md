		I am a former hotelier who is excited to begin my new career in web development. After a highly successful career in hotel management, I was ready for a change. I have always been interested in computers, often being the go-to guy for IT issues at my hotels. As someone who enjoys problem solving and has a natural curiosity about how the Web works, web development is a perfect fit for me.

		I have a lot of experience as a team leader, but I am looking to start on the ground floor and work my way up, learning all I can along the way.
