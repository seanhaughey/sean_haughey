    I am a former hotel manager who is excited to begin my new career in web development. After a highly successful career in hospitality, I am ready for a change. I have always been interested in computers, often being the go-to guy for IT issues. As someone who enjoys problem solving and has a natural curiosity about how the web works, web development is a perfect fit for me.
    <br>
    <br>
	My first step into this new career was completing General Assembly's twelve week Web Development Immersive program. This class has given me the tools I need to become a web developer. Please check out my <a href="/projects">projects page</a> to see the apps I built over the course of the twelve weeks. Some of the technologies I used for these were HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby, Rails, Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Meteor.

    I have a lot of experience as a team leader, but I am looking to start on the ground floor and work my way up, learning all I can along the way.
