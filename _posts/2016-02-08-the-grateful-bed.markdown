So this story goes back to my first week in the hotel business. I had just moved to the Lake Tahoe area and had gotten a job as an honor bar attendant at the brand new and very swanky Resort at Squaw Creek in Squaw Valley, CA. The job included a ski pass and health insurance and very little income. But I could ski. Everyday. Awesome!

Man was it a tedious job, though. Every single day we had to go into every single room in the hotel and check the minibars. Restock what had been used and charge the guests (inevitably with about 50% of these charges disputed at check out). This was mind numbingly dull work. But at least we usually had a partner with us. Someone to talk to and commiserate with.

So anyway, my first week on the job coincided with the Squaw Valley Summer Music Festival with none other than the Jerry Garcia Band headlining. Now I have always been a huge music fan, but I never really got much into the Grateful Dead. I fully appreciate their talent and enjoying listening to the occasional Dead tune but they were never really my thing. The other 99.99% of Tahoe residents are absolutely fanatical about the Dead and all things Jerry! I had no idea. I mean the town was going crazy and the hotel was buzzing because Jerry was staying with us!

On the first morning after Mr. Garcia's arrival, I happened to be working with one of the most fanatical Deadheads I had ever met. This girl was absolutely insane! First order of the day? We needed to go see if Jerry needed his honor bar restocked. On the way up the elevator she was so giddy. "You think he'll be there? What if he is and he meets me and falls in love with me and then we get married?!"

Oh boy. This could go very badly. Thankfully, we knocked on the door and nobody answered. So we opened the door and entered his suite. The look on this girl's face was hilarious. It was like the look on people's faces when they saw what was inside Marsellus Wallace's briefcase in Pulp Fiction. She started poking around, looking at all of his stuff. Then we went upstairs to his bedroom. Or as she called it - Mecca. 

His bed had not yet been made up and it had some of his dirty clothes on it. Little did I know this was exactly what she was hoping for. She got a running start and leapt into the bed. She started rolling around in his dirty sheets and clothes like a pig in the mud. And the look of absolute ecstasy on her face was priceless. She must have stayed in there for a good 15-20 minutes. Yes, it was very uncomfortable for me, but I couldn't interrupt her moment of zen. 

She finally climbed out of his bed and begrudgingly agreed with me that it was time to leave. On the way out, she spotted a dirty sock on the floor, picked it up and shoved it in her pocket. A sock?! Yes. She stole Jerry's sock. I imagine that to this day she probably huffs that sock everyday. The rest of the day it was like she was on a high from the experience. (Or maybe she was just actually high.) And she told everyone she saw that day how she had been in Jerry's bed. I think she was purposely vague as to whether or not he was in there with her.

From that day forward I vowed to never go to a Grateful Dead show...
