There is rarely a dull day when working at a hotel, but some days are way more exciting than others. On this particular day I was working at a very high end hotel that had just recently opened in northwest Austin, TX. I was standing in the lobby chatting with a guest when I looked over at the front desk and a girl who couldn't be more than 20 years old walked up to check in. Something about her didn't seem right so I walked up to the desk to get a better look. She wasn't dressed like our typical guest, but I never judged anyone by her/his attire. It was more her demeanor that struck me as odd. She seemed very nervous and in quite a hurry to get into a room.

When she paid for the room in cash pulled out of a duffle bag, I really began to think my gut feeling was right. And then she refused any change. My Spidey senses were definitely tingling at this point. But I didn't have any proof of any wrongdoing so there wasn't much I could do other than keep an eye on her.

Not more than five minutes after she headed up to her room, a housekeeper called down to the front desk. The woman who just checked into room 634 had bolted out of her room, ran down the hall and threw something down the back stairwell. Then she sprinted to the other end of the hall and flew down that stairwell and out the fire exit. It appeared my gut was right!

I sprinted up to the 6th floor and grabbed the item she had thrown down the stairs. It was a bunch of 20 dollar bills glued together in a roll. When I squeezed the roll I could tell there was something in the middle. I'm no detective but I was pretty sure this was some kind of tracking device from a bank. I immediately called 911.

When I gave all of the details to the 911 operator, she informed me that a bank had indeed been robbed by a female suspect just a few miles away and the police would be here shortly. Holy crap! Shit just got real!

In less than five minutes two guys entered the hotel. One was in full blown tourist attire - Hawaiian shirt and shorts - and the other was wearing a tee shirt and jeans. They asked for me, showed me their badges and then introduced themselves. The one in the tourist getup was FBI. The other was from the Austin PD bank robbery unit. Not exactly who I had expected to show up. They asked me to describe the girl. Wow! At that point I realized how terrible a witness I am. I think all I could come up with was that she was short and had dark hair. They showed me surveillance footage from the bank and asked me if it was her. Um, could be I guess. I'm pretty sure I cracked the case right there.

The cop checked into the room across the hall from hers and the FBI agent hung out in the lobby to look out for her. And then she returned. And all hell broke loose! This is actual footage of what went down:

Ok, well not really. Sadly it was not nearly that exciting. As a matter of fact the ending is pretty boring. The FBI agent hung out in the lobby for several hours. We discussed the finer points of Point Break and I asked him why the FBI screwed up the whole Die Hard hostage situation. He explained to me that FBI agents aren't actually the bumbling idiots who don't get along with the local police like they are portrayed to be in the movies. I'm still not sure I believe him, but he seemed pretty competent and likeable.

After about four or five hours, they left saying that there was not a chance that she would be coming back to the hotel. The next morning she ended up turning herself into the police. A pretty anti-climatic ending.
