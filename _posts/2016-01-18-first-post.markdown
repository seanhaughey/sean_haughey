So I wasn't sure if I wanted to start a blog on my personal website. At first I was thinking maybe I would blog about my career change and my job search and blah blah blah...

But then I realized it would be a lot of fun to take all of my stories from my years in the hotel biz and put them into writing - now that I am no longer working in hotels and have no risk of being fired! 

My hope is that if you read my tales, you will learn how to (and how not to) treat the wonderful folks in the hospitality industry. Remember - you are always more likely to get what you want by treating them with kindness and respect than by berating them and talking down to them.

I'm going to start this off with one my favorite topics - housekeeping stole something from my room. I will always remember the time a woman came down to the front desk one evening and uttered those dreaded words - I need to speak to a manager. Now if someone says I would like to speak with a manager you know there is maybe a 2% chance that it's something good. But when they say I NEED, well there's not a chance in hell that it's good. I approached her and asked her how I could help her. She was holding a bag and was visibly upset. She began by telling me that she was sure her housekeeper had stolen her cellphone out of this bag which had been in her room. 

She then proceeded to tell me the story of her whole day. She had the phone in the morning and when she went to her office, she had placed it in this bag. It had remained in there during her entire work day. She then came back to the hotel and placed the bag in her room at about 5pm and went out for dinner with some colleagues. When she returned to her room around 7pm, she discovered that her phone was missing. Turns out it was an old flip phone and she has no idea why anyone would want it, but she was sure that housekeeping had stolen it sometime while she was at dinner.

I stood there trying to muster up the right amount of empathy, but I'm thinking to myself that I know our housekeeping team pretty well, and I can't imagine any one of them risking losing her/his job over a worthless flip phone. And this woman has made it very clear that this is a worthless old phone that nobody would want. 

I start asking her a few questions. "Was the bag with you all day at the office?"

"Well, no. I left it in the reception area while I visited with various people."

"Was anyone watching it while it was in the reception area?"

"Well, no. It was sitting alone."

"Did you check if the phone was in the bag at any time from when you left it at work until you got back from dinner?"

"No I did not."

"Is there any chance it could have gone missing from your office?"

"Absolutely not! No one there would do such a thing."

"Ok, ma'am. Is it alright if I look in the bag?"

Oh that's right. Nobody in your office would take it. Only the housekeeper who we trust to clean hundreds of rooms a month would steal something so worthless.

She hands me the bag, which is kind of a small duffel bag. The top is unzipped and wide open. The first thing my eyes are drawn to is an envelope right on top. It has something green in it. I look more closely and it's money. Hundred dollar bills! There must be a couple thousand dollars in there!

"Ma'am, was that envelope full of money in your bag along with the phone?"

"Yes."

"Was it on top like that? Was the phone under it?"

"Um, yes."

"So you think one of our housekeepers took your phone but left the envelope full of money?" 

"I guess that doesn't seem likely."

Uh ya think? The phone was literally hidden under a pile of money. Worst. Thief. Ever.

"No, ma'am. Not likely at all."

Then she walked away without so much as an apology for her false accusation.

Yeah. Don't be that person.
